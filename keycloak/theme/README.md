# WunderGraph Keycloak theme

Note: **Haven't added this package into the pnpm workspace because pnpm fails to install the required modules of a particular package**

## What youâ€™ll need

Java 17 + Maven. For example see https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/install-maven-linux-ubuntu

## Build the theme extension
-  Change the theme.
