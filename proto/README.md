# TypeScript Connect Client

This directory contains the protobuf definitions for the [Connect RPC API](https://connectrpc.com/). We generate TypeScript and Go code from these definitions.

## Structure

- `node` contains the protobuf definitions for the Router API.
- `platform` contains the protobuf definitions for the Platform API.
- `common` contains the protobuf definitions for common types used by both APIs.
